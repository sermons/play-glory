But now thus says the LORD, <br/>
he who **created** you, O Jacob, <br/>
he who **formed** you, O Israel:

“Fear not, for I have **redeemed** you; <br/>
I have **called** you by name, <br/>
you are **mine** ...

(Isaiah 43:1, ESV, 1/2)

Fear not, for I am **with** you; I will ...

Bring my **sons** from afar and <br/>
my **daughters** from the end of the earth,

everyone who is **called** by my **Name**, <br/>
whom I **created** for my **glory**, <br/>
whom I **formed** and made.”

**Bless** the Lord, O my soul, <br/>
and forget not all his **benefits**,

who **forgives** all your iniquity, <br/>
who **heals** all your diseases, ...

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://sermons.seanho.com/img/bg/unsplash-OjE4RtaibFc-eagle.jpg" -->
who **redeems** your life from the pit, <br/>
who **crowns** you with steadfast love and mercy,

who **satisfies** you with good so that <br/>
your **youth** is renewed like the eagle's. ...

For as high as the **heavens** <br/>
are above the **earth**,

so great is his **steadfast love** <br/>
toward those who **fear him**;

as far as the **east** is from the **west**, <br/>
so far does he remove <br/>
our **transgressions** from us. ...

As a **father** shows compassion <br/>
to his **children**,

so the Lord shows **compassion** <br/>
to those who **fear him**.

For he **knows** our frame; <br/>
he remembers that we are **dust**.

<div class="caption">
(Psalm 103:13-14, ESV, 4/4)

If we consider the unblushing **promises** <br/>
of reward ... in the Gospels,

it would seem that our Lord finds <br/>
our **desires** not too strong, but **too weak**. ...

We are **half-hearted** creatures, <br/>
fooling about with <br/>
**drink** and **sex** and **ambition** ...

when **infinite joy** is offered us, ...

<div class="caption">
(C.S. Lewis, "The Weight of Glory", 1941, 2/3)
</div>

like an **ignorant child** who wants <br/>
to go on making **mud pies** in a slum

because he cannot **imagine** what is meant <br/>
by the offer of a **holiday at sea**.

We are far **too easily pleased**.

1. Christian Hedonism
1. **Calendar Zero**
1. Active Rest

## 2. Calendar Zero
1. **Exercise** is of Some Value
1. **Friends** of the Heart

**Train** yourself for godliness:

for while **bodily** training is of **some** value, <br/>
**godliness** is of value in **every** way,

as it holds **promise** for the **present** life <br/>
and also for the life **to come**. ...

<div class="caption">
(1 Timothy 4:7b-8, ESV, 1/2)
</div>

---
For to this end we **toil** and **strive**:

because we have our **hope** set <br/>
on the **living God**,

who is the **Savior** of all people, <br/>
especially of those who **believe**.

<div class="caption">
(1 Timothy 4:10, ESV, 2/2)
</div>

Do you not know that in a **race** <br/>
all the runners **run**, <br/>
but only one receives the **prize**?

So **run** that you may **obtain** it.

Every **athlete** exercises <br/>
**self-control** in all things.

They do it to receive a **perishable** wreath, <br/>
but we an **imperishable**. ...

<div class="caption">
(1 Corinthians 9:24-25, ESV, 1/2)
</div>

---
So I do not run **aimlessly**; <br/>
I do not box as one beating the **air**.

But I **discipline** my body <br/>
and keep it under **control**,

lest after preaching to **others** <br/>
I **myself** should be disqualified.

<div class="caption">
(1 Corinthians 9:26-27, ESV, 2/2)

[Pray] for us as well, <br/>
that God will open up to us <br/>
a **door** for the Word,

so that we may **speak forth** <br/>
the **mystery** of Christ, <br/>
for which I have also been imprisoned;

that I may make it **clear** <br/>
in the way I ought to **speak**. ...

<div class="caption">

Conduct yourselves <br/>
with **wisdom** toward outsiders, <br/>
making the most of the **opportunity**.

Let your speech always be with **grace**, <br/>
as though **seasoned** with salt,

so that you will know <br/>
how you should **respond** to each person.

(Colossians 4:5-6, NASB, 2/2)

For you are all **sons of light** and sons of day.

We are not of **night** nor of darkness; <br/>
so then let us not **sleep** as others do,

but let us be **alert** and **sober**.

## 3. Active Rest
1. Awake, for the Night is Coming
1. **Rest, for the Sabbath is Coming**

So then, there remains <br/>
a **Sabbath rest** for the people of God,

for whoever has entered **God's rest** <br/>
has also rested from **his works** <br/>
as **God** did from his.

Let us therefore **strive** to enter that rest, <br/>
so that no one may **fall** <br/>
by the same sort of **disobedience**.

<div class="caption">
(Hebrews 4:9-11, ESV)

For God **alone** my soul **waits** in silence; <br/>
from him comes my **salvation**.

He alone is my **rock** and my **salvation**, <br/>
my **fortress**;

I shall not be greatly **shaken**.
