## Work for the Glory of God
1. Aspire to be a **fool**, not a professional
1. Work to train your **heart**
1. Toil for God's kingdom by resting in His **victory**

>>>
+ Pitfall: snare of **Professionalism**
  + Chasing the **Guild**
  + Building **Ambition**
  + Earning **Wages**

  + Rejecting **Idleness**
  + **Sharing** Generously

1. Made for His **Glory**
1. The Highest **Joy**

But now thus says the LORD, <br/>
he who **created** you, O Jacob, <br/>
he who **formed** you, O Israel:

“Fear not, for I have **redeemed** you; <br/>
I have **called** you by name, <br/>
you are **mine** ...

<div class="caption">
(Isaiah 43:1, ESV)
</div>

---
Fear not, for I am with you; I will ...

Bring my **sons** from afar and <br/>
my **daughters** from the end of the earth,

everyone who is **called** by my **Name**, <br/>
whom I **created** for my **glory**, <br/>
whom I **formed** and made.”

<div class="caption">
(Isaiah 43:5-7, ESV)

## 1. Christian Hedonism
1. Made for His Glory
1. **The Highest Joy**

---
**Bless** the Lord, O my soul,
and forget not all his **benefits**,

who **forgives** all your iniquity,
who **heals** all your diseases,

who **redeems** your life from the pit,
who **crowns** you with steadfast love and mercy,

who **satisfies** you with good
so that your **youth** is renewed like the eagle's

<div class="caption">
(Psalm 103:2-4, ESV)
</div>

---
For as high as the **heavens** <br/>
are above the **earth**, <br/>
so great is his **steadfast love** <br/>
toward those who **fear him**;

as far as the **east** is from the **west**, <br/>
so far does he remove <br/>
our **transgressions** from us.

<div class="caption">
(Psalm 103:11-12, ESV)
</div>

---
As a **father** shows compassion <br/>
to his **children**,

so the Lord shows **compassion** <br/>
to those who **fear him**.

For he **knows** our frame; <br/>
he remembers that we are **dust**.

<div class="caption">
(Psalm 103:13-14, ESV)
</div>

---
If we consider the unblushing **promises** <br/>
of reward ... promised in the Gospels,

it would seem that our Lord finds <br/>
our **desires** not too strong, but **too weak**.

We are **half-hearted** creatures, <br/>
fooling about with <br/>
**drink** and **sex** and **ambition** ...

<div class="caption">
(C.S. Lewis, "The Weight of Glory", 1941)
</div>

---
when **infinite joy** is offered us,

like an **ignorant child** who wants <br/>
to go on making **mud pies** in a slum

because he cannot **imagine** what is meant <br/>
by the offer of a **holiday at sea**.

We are far **too easily pleased**.

## Play for the Glory of God
1. Christian Hedonism
1. **Calendar Zero**
1. Active Rest

---
## 2. Calendar Zero
1. **Exercise** is of Some Value
1. **Friends** of the Heart

---
**Train** yourself for godliness:

for while **bodily** training is of **some** value, <br/>
**godliness** is of value in **every** way,

as it holds **promise** for the **present** life <br/>
and also for the life **to come**. ...

<div class="caption">
(1 Timothy 4:7b-8, ESV)
</div>

---
For to this end we **toil** and **strive**:

because we have our **hope** set <br/>
on the **living God**,

who is the **Savior** of all people, <br/>
especially of those who **believe**.

<div class="caption">
(1 Timothy 4:10, ESV)
</div>

---
Do you not know that in a **race** <br/>
all the runners **run**, <br/>
but only one receives the **prize**?

So **run** that you may **obtain** it.

Every **athlete** exercises <br/>
**self-control** in all things.

They do it to receive a **perishable** wreath, <br/>
but we an **imperishable**. ...

<div class="caption">
(1 Corinthians 9:24-25, ESV)
</div>

---
So I do not run **aimlessly**; <br/>
I do not box as one beating the **air**.

But I **discipline** my body <br/>
and keep it under **control**,

lest after preaching to **others** <br/>
I **myself** should be disqualified.

<div class="caption">
(1 Corinthians 9:26-27, ESV)
</div>

## 2. Calendar Zero
1. Exercise is of Some Value
1. **Friends of the Heart**

---
[Pray] at the same time for us as well, <br/>
that God will open up to us <br/>
a **door** for the Word,

so that we may **speak forth** <br/>
the **mystery** of Christ, <br/>
for which I have also been **imprisoned**;

that I may make it **clear** <br/>
in the way I ought to **speak**. ...

<div class="caption">
(Colossians 4:3-4, NASB)
</div>

---
Conduct yourselves <br/>
with **wisdom** toward outsiders, <br/>
making the most of the **opportunity**.

Let your speech always be with **grace**, <br/>
as though **seasoned** with salt,

so that you will know <br/>
how you should **respond** to each person.

<div class="caption">
(Colossians 4:5-6, NASB)

## Play for the Glory of God

1. **Active Rest**

## 3. Active Rest
1. **Awake**, for the **Night** is Coming
1. **Rest**, for the **Sabbath** is Coming

---
For you are all **sons of light** and sons of day.

We are not of **night** nor of darkness; <br/>
so then let us not **sleep** as others do,

but let us be **alert** and **sober**.

<div class="caption">
(1 Thessalonians 5:5-6, NASB)

## 3. Active Rest
1. Awake, for the Night is Coming
1. **Rest, for the Sabbath is Coming**

---
So then, there remains <br/>
a **Sabbath rest** for the people of God,

for whoever has entered **God's rest** <br/>
has also rested from **his works** <br/>
as **God** did from his.

Let us therefore **strive** to enter that rest, <br/>
so that no one may **fall** <br/>
by the same sort of **disobedience**.

<div class="caption">
(Hebrews 4:9-11, ESV)
</div>

---
For God **alone** my soul **waits** in silence; <br/>
from him comes my **salvation**.

He alone is my **rock** and my **salvation**, <br/>
my **fortress**;

I shall not be greatly **shaken**.
